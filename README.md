# 🏠 Case Study: Identifying Underperforming Assets & Improving Portfolio ROI  
**Financial KPI Dashboard for Real Estate Portfolio Optimization**

## ✅ Executive Summary  
A real estate investment portfolio consisting of four rental properties produced inconsistent financial performance.  
The finance team managing the portfolio lacked a unified view of rent trends, expenses, cash flow, and ROI.  
Key challenges emerged:

- Net income fluctuated month to month  
- One property appeared to “break even” despite stable occupancy  
- Expense patterns were unclear  
- Long-term ROI and cash-on-cash returns were difficult to measure  
- Reporting required multiple spreadsheets and manual consolidation  

To address this, a **Real Estate Financial Analytics Dashboard** was created to centralize financial performance data and provide KPI-driven insights for investment decisions.

---

# ✅ Step 1 — Portfolio Data Consolidation & KPI Modeling  
Historical data—including rent rolls, operating expenses, maintenance logs, and mortgage payments—was consolidated into a single analytical model.

### ✅ Core Investment KPIs Produced  
- **Net Operating Income (NOI)**  
- **Cash Flow After Debt Service**  
- **Expense Ratio**  
- **ROI & Cash-on-Cash Return**  
- **Annualized Rent Growth**  
- **Maintenance Cost Trends**  
- **Property-Level Operating Margins**  

### 📊 Portfolio Financial Dashboard

For the first time, the portfolio had a consolidated, transparent view of its true financial performance.

---

# ✅ Step 2 — Performance Diagnosis & Issue Detection  
With standardized KPIs, several financially meaningful insights surfaced:

1. **Property 2** had an expense ratio of **58%**, significantly above portfolio norms.  
2. **Property 4** generated strong NOI but minimal cash flow due to an expensive mortgage.  
3. Seasonal maintenance and utility spikes were previously hidden in fragmented spreadsheets.  
4. **Property 1** had flat rent growth for 18 months, holding portfolio ROI back.  

### 📈 NOI Breakdown

### 📈 Monthly Rental Income Trend

The dashboard pinpointed exactly where operating inefficiencies and ROI drag were coming from.

---

# ✅ Step 3 — Financial Modeling & Scenario Planning  
The investor evaluated multiple strategic scenarios using model-driven recalculations.

### ✅ Scenario A — Refinance Property 4  
- Lower mortgage rate reduces debt service by **18%**  
- Cash flow increases by **~$240 per month**

### ✅ Scenario B — Adjust Rent for Property 1  
- $75 rent increase raises annual ROI by **1.1%**

### ✅ Scenario C — Reduce Maintenance Costs for Property 2  
- Strategic outsourcing cuts yearly maintenance expenses by **22%**

### 📉 Monthly Expenses Visualization

Each scenario instantly updates KPIs, making planning decisions data-driven rather than intuitive guesswork.

---

# ✅ Step 4 — Strategic Recommendations  
Based on the portfolio analysis:

- **Refinance Property 4** to unlock hidden cash flow  
- **Implement rent adjustments** for underperforming units  
- **Address maintenance inefficiencies** for Property 2  
- Direct future capital into properties with stronger long-term ROI  
- Use the dashboard monthly for ongoing rent, expense, and ROI monitoring

Within one quarter of using the analytics dashboard:

- ✅ Portfolio cash flow increased **15–18%**  
- ✅ Underperforming properties improved after cost optimization  
- ✅ Manual reporting time decreased by **25%**  
- ✅ Rent adjustments improved income stability  
- ✅ Portfolio decisions became proactive and data-driven
